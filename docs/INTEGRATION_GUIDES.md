# Integration Guides

## FastAPI + React (API Consumption)
1. Create an org + API key from the governance service.
2. Store the key securely in your server environment.
3. Call `/policies`, `/resources`, and `/evaluations` from your backend.
4. Use `/evidence/export` to generate audit-ready reports.

## Node/TypeScript Integration
- Use `sdk/typescript` to create policies and evaluate access.

## Python Integration
- Use `sdk/python` to create policies, register resources, and export evidence.
