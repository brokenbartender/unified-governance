# Compliance Alignment

## SOC 2 (Security)
- Access control: API key scopes + org isolation
- Logging: evaluation records + hash chain
- Integrity: evidence export with HMAC signature
- Retention: configurable retention window

## ISO 27001 (Annex A)
- A.5 Policies: documented PRD + roadmap
- A.8 Asset management: resource catalog with source/external IDs
- A.12 Logging: evidence logs with chain-of-custody

## NIST AI RMF
- Govern: policy-as-code + org ownership
- Measure: evaluation log + evidence export
- Manage: retention policy

## Gaps (next phase)
- SSO enforcement (currently configuration stub)
- Incident response playbooks
- Change management workflows
- Full risk assessment workflows
