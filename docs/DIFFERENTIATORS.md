# Differentiators

## Evidence Integrity Layer
- Hash?chained evaluations
- HMAC?signed exports (CSV/JSON)
- Attestation digests (daily)

## Decision Replay Proofs
- Replay endpoint to verify historical decisions
- Drift detection vs current policy state

## Acquisition?Ready Export
- Data room export of orgs, policies, evidence
- Compliance?ready documentation set

## Competitive Baseline
- OPA: strong policy engine, minimal evidence chain
- Styra/Aserto: decision logs, limited cryptographic evidence chain

Unified Governance Layer combines policy engine + tamper?evident evidence + buyer?ready diligence exports.
